# About Me
Hi! I'm Kaushik.

I’m diving into Git and GitHub basics as part of an internship task.  
Currently learning and trying out different Git commands like commit, branch, and merge. 

Skills I’m currently developing:
Understanding GitHub workflows  
Getting exposure to working with APIs  
Apart from coding, I enjoy exploring my creative side — someday, I’d love to write a poem
