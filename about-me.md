# About Me
Hi! I'm Kaushik.

I’m diving into Git and GitHub basics as part of an internship task.  
Currently learning and trying out different Git commands like commit, branch, and merge.  
It’s been a fun experience so far, and I’m starting to get the hang of how version control works.  
Hoping to get more comfortable with real-world workflows soon!
